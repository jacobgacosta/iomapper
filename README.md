## About IOmapper

**IOMapper** was created to easing data mapping on objects avoiding writing a large amount of setters and getters methods, as well the multiple instances creation  that only have the extracting and assigning values purpose. IOMapper takes the pain out of development by offering a more pleasant way to relate the source and target data manipulation through a sweeter and cleaner syntax, delegating presentation layer to a foreign entity.

**IOMapper** offers the following functionalities taking into account the most common data mapping tasks:

- Automatic mapping of fields with the same name
- Custom mapping in fields with different **source/target** names
- Mapping nested fields through custom mappings
- Ignoring of fields for automatic mapping operations
- Ignoring of nested fields for automatic mapping operations
- Execution of functions on fields **(source)**
- Execution of nested functions on fields **(source)**

**IOMapper** is accessible, powerful and puts at your fingertips the possibility to scale and add new functionalities that will allow you to perform more complex mapping to meet your needs.
